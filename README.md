- ğŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Mehayla
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things, but I have a particular fondness for Books, Film making, Music, and of course coding.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowedlge Python and SQL from my background in HTML and CSS. 
- âœ¨ My favorite fact is that we all were made from star dust and that everything in this world is remade.
